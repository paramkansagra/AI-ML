Classification is a important part of AI-ML and is very diffrent from regression

In regression we were predicting the values of the future using some data that we have with us right now

In classification we would predict the catagory of a new observation based on training data

It is a type of supervised learning algorithm

Eg. we have n number of customers and we want to find how many will stay and how many will leave (churn modelling)

Eg. Classification in mails

Eg. Image recognizition where we would be able to catagorize the diffrent images from dogs to cats
